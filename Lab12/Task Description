The following tasks need be completed:

1. Clean your computer from adware and spyware.
2. Install Nmap.
3. Learn the command syntax and functionality of Nmap.
4. Determine your IP address.
5. Perform a clean scan of your subnet without attracting attention. Use the appropriate
setting when scanning and 24 bit width.
6. Perform an ARP scan of your subnet using 24 bits. Analyze the scan and draw
conclusions.
7. Select any host from the results in step 4 or 5 and perform a UDP scan on the default
port. Compare the current results with those obtained in step 4 or 5.
8. Scan your network using half-open connections. Compare with the result from step 4.
9. Select the target host from the commands offered for research (Appendix B).
10. Scan the target host's open ports:
1. What ports were discovered and what services / services are they responsible for?
2. Use the literature or the Internet and determine which services / services from the
detected vulnerabilities?
3. Track the path to the target host.
4. Determine the operating system of the target host. If resisted, enter the appropriate
value with 50 attempts. Comment on the result.
5. Ping to the target computer, adjusting the request response timeout.
6. Ping the target computer and set the maximum number of request retransmissions.
7. Implement a time control option when scanning the target host. Adjust the delay
between requests. Comment on the result.
8. Perform a disguise scan of the target host using bogus hosts. Select any of the
provided hosts in Appendix B.
9. Scan the target host with spoofing the original address.
10. Output the scan results at any of the steps (3-9) in XML format.
11. With the help of the NSE engine, implement a script that combines 2-3 tasks that you
have already done earlier and display the incoming and outgoing connections.
12. Prepare a progress report.
