As part of the laboratory work, the following tasks are performed:
1. Using the service https://2ip.ru/, determine your external network address (take a
screenshot).
2. Using the service https://2ip.ru/port-scaner/, scan for open ports on your machine. Take
a screenshot and analyze the test results.
3. Using the service https://hidemy.name/en/port-scanner/, perform a rescanning of ports
by entering your network address in the appropriate field. Take a screenshot and analyze the
test results. Which ports / protocols / services, in your opinion, are the most dangerous /
vulnerable, and which are the most secure?
4. Review the current document and complete the tasks:
1. Select and research one of the list of free intrusion detection systems. Give the features
of the IDS under investigation, and explore the interface.
2. Review the documentation of any of the commercial intrusion detection systems and
compare the functionality with the previously investigated IDS.
3. Investigate any of the vulnerability scanners listed in the document. Check out the
